# Amazon Clone

This is Flutter E-Commerce App with a Backend. This Shopping App uses Javascript, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose and is designed for beginners. This Flutter project covers the complete UI of Amazon including features like auth with email/password, cart, searching products, fetching them based on category, rating them, fetching deal of the day, checking out using GPay/Apple Pay, viewing the orders, the details of the order along with their status which can be changed from the admin panel, view total sales and graph of sales based on category.

I build the UI of Amazon from scratch, create REST APIs using Node, store data in MongoDB using Mongoose, use REST APIs with Flutter & Dart using Models, use the Flutter State Management tool as Provider and create a cross-platform app that works on Android and iOS.
